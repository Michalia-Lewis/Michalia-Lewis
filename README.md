## Hi there 👋

I'm a grad student in Northeastern University's Align program pursuing my Master's in Computer Science. Before pivoting to tech, I moved across the world to work as an assistant language teacher in Japan ✈️ — my very first flight, by the way.

When I'm not coding or studying, you'll probably find me gaming, watching anime, or doing both at the same time 🎮 I love building projects that combine my interests with what I'm learning — check out [The Otaku Filing Cabinet](https://github.com/Michalia-Lewis/the-otaku-filing-cabinet)!

Currently learning: Python, with Java on the horizon. 🌱
